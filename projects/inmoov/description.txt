A collaboration project between Aalto University and Futurice, presented in a public gala. Prototyping different approaches to telepresence using the open source robot InMoov, including:
	- Microsoft Kinect-based motion capture/replication (ROS)
	- Physical prototypes for capturing arm/hand/head movements (IMUs / resistors + Arduino)

Unfortunately live footage is lost in time.
